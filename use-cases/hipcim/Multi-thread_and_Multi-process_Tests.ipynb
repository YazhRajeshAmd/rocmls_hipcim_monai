    "\n",
    "`input/image.tif` file (whose size is 19920x26420 and tile size is 256x256) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since hipCIM doesn't implement internal cache yet, according to `start_location` variable in the experiment code, hipCIM would have a different performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the first case (`start_location = 0`), when we try to read the whole image starting from (0,0) with 256x256 patch size, both OpenSlide and hipCIM would read each time only once.\n",
    "However, in the second case (`start_location = 1`) that starts reading patch from (1,1), hipCIM would have a disadvantage -- for the second patch (second red box), hipCIM should need four tiles whereas OpenSlide would use only two tiles (two tiles in the middle would be cached when OpenSlide read the first patch).\n",
