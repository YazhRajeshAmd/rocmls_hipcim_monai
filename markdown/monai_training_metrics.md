<strong>Loss</strong> measures how well the model's predictions match the target values; lower
values indicate better fit. 
<strong>Dice</strong> indicates the overlap between predicted and true segments; higher values
reflect more accurate segmentation.<br>
<strong>Accuracy</strong> is the proportion of correct predictions among all predictions; 
<strong>Precision</strong> is the fraction of positive predictions that are actually correct.
